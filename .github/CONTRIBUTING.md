# Contributor Guide

Before getting started, thanks for considering taking time to contribute! All contributions, big or small, are welcome and appreciated.

## It's not FOSS

*Actually..* it depends. This guide is the same one used on my free addons and my commercial addons. If you're unsure if this addon is paid, please check it's listing on the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/marketplace). If it's marked as paid, then it's commercial and the following applies:

* You cannot redistribute or use this addon in another project - open source or not - without prior permission or licensing.
* You can't maintain a long-term fork of this addon. A short-time public one for a PR is fine but a long-term private one isn't. I trust you won't abuse it.

## How You Can Contribute

### Bug Reports

Before opening a bug report, please search through this addon's open issues to double check there's not already an issue. 

If you find an existing issue, please give it a thumbs up üëç  reaction, rather than leaving a comment. That is, unless you have anything else to add.

Otherwise, if you cant't find a similar issue, please submit a new one. Make sure to include as much information as possible and to follow the issue template. It's there to make my and your life an awful lot easier.

### Feature Requests

If you've got a feature request, it's pretty much the same procedure as bug reports. Search for similar issues first, otherwise, submit a fresh one.

### Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please [email Duncan directly](mailto:hello@doublethree.digital) and **do not** go through the issue tracker.

### Documentation Edits

On most addon repositories, you'll find the documentation located straight in the `README.md` file in the repositories root. Documentation updates are always appreciated, they help to make the product just that little bit better! 

When updating the documentation, please try to adopt the same writing style & formatting that is already there. 

### Pull Requests

I actually really love reviewing pull requests and I'm always happy when a new one comes into my inbox! 

When submitting a pull request, please make sure to [reference any issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) related to the PR. Please also try to keep with the same code style as the existing code. It's not a biggie though, I can always tweak it later.
